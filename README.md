# WebGL Cellular Automata
Multi-state 8-neighbor [totalistic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cellular_automaton#/Totalistic) 2D cellular automata simulation written in WebGL, with support for random rule generation.

Totalistic 2D automata are a set of automata that include Conway's Game of Life, Wireworld, Brian's Brain, and more, all of which are presets. Help me find new interesting rules to include in the presets!
